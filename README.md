This basic photo gallery app features a responsive and flexible layout, thanks to Masonry's dynamic grid system. This allows users to view photos of different sizes and orientations, and easily organize them in a visually appealing way. The app also uses React to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, with smooth transitions between pages and a clean, modern design.
